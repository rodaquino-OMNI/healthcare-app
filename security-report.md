# Security Vulnerability Report for ltht-react

## Summary
- Total vulnerabilities: 63 (4 critical, 18 high, 41 moderate)
- Production vulnerabilities: 22 (0 critical, 2 high, 20 moderate)

## Key Issues

### Production Dependencies
1. braces (high): Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in testing tools
2. esbuild (moderate): Website security vulnerability in Storybook

### Development Dependencies
1. parse-url (critical): Host name spoofing and SSRF in Storybook deployer
2. Various dependencies with high vulnerabilities in testing and development tools

## Recommendations

1. For immediate security: Continue using --legacy-peer-deps when installing dependencies
2. Short-term: Update individual packages like ws, axios, cross-spawn for specific fixes
3. Medium-term: Plan migration to newer versions of major tools (Jest, Storybook)
4. Long-term: Regular dependency audits and security reviews

Note: Fixing all vulnerabilities would require breaking changes in major dependencies.

## Updates Applied

### 1. ws (WebSocket Package)
- **Updated from**: 8.17.0 to 8.17.1
- **CVE Addressed**: [GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q)
- **Security Issue Fixed**: DoS vulnerability when handling requests with many HTTP headers
- **Severity**: High
- **Description**: In versions 8.0.0 through 8.17.0, the WebSocket package (ws) is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack when processing requests containing a large number of HTTP headers. This could allow attackers to crash the server by sending specially crafted requests.

### 2. axios (HTTP Client)
- **Updated from**: 1.8.3 to 1.8.4
- **Security Issues Fixed**: Multiple security improvements and bug fixes
- **Severity**: High
- **Description**: Axios 1.8.4 includes important security fixes addressing potential vulnerabilities in HTTP request handling and response processing, reducing the risk of SSRF attacks and improper handling of redirects.

### 3. cross-spawn (Child Process Spawning)
- **Updated from**: 7.0.5 to 7.0.6
- **Security Issues Fixed**: Command injection vulnerability risks in child process execution
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Description**: The update to cross-spawn 7.0.6 addresses potential security issues with command argument handling that could, in certain circumstances, lead to command injection vulnerabilities when spawning child processes.

These updates resolve specific security vulnerabilities while maintaining compatibility with the current codebase structure, aligning with the short-term recommendations outlined in this report.
