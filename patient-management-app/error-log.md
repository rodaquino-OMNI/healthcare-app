## Detailed Issue Log

### TS-001: React Import Errors

**Description:**  
Multiple components have issues with React imports due to TypeScript configuration problems.

**Severity:** High (Prevents application compilation)

**Technical Context:**  
The application is attempting to use named imports from React, but TypeScript is configured in a way that doesn't recognize these imports.

**Evidence:**
```
ERROR in src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:1:17
TS2614: Module '"react"' has no exported member 'createContext'. Did you mean to use 'import createContext from "react"' instead?
```

**Affected Files:**
- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
- src/contexts/PatientContext.tsx 
- src/import-test.tsx
- src/pages/appointment/AppointmentDetail.tsx
- src/pages/appointment/AppointmentList.tsx
- src/pages/appointment/AppointmentSchedule.tsx
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
- src/pages/Login.tsx
- src/pages/medication/MedicationDetail.tsx
- src/pages/medication/MedicationList.tsx
- src/pages/medication/PrescriptionForm.fixed.tsx
- src/pages/medication/PrescriptionForm.tsx
- src/pages/patient/PatientList.tsx
- src/utils/ltht-component-wrappers.tsx

**Root Cause:**
After thorough investigation, we found that despite `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` being set to true in the TypeScript configuration, there's a more complex issue at play:

1. The file `react-module-fix.d.ts` attempts to augment the 'react' module declarations but is creating conflicts with the actual React typing.

2. The application appears to be using a version of TypeScript or project configuration that's not compatible with the current augmentation approach.

3. There's a circular reference issue in the type declarations where 'react' module tries to export from itself.

**Recommended Fix:**
Two potential approaches:

1. **Complete React Type Re-declaration Approach**
   ```typescript
   // In src/types/react-module-fix.d.ts
   declare module 'react' {
     const createContext: any;
     const useContext: any;
     const useState: any;
     const useEffect: any;
     // Include other React exports
     
     const React: any;
     export default React;
   }
   ```

2. **Component-level import correction (pragmatic approach)**
   Update components to use default imports instead of named imports:
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   const { useState, useEffect } = React;
   ```

3. **System-Wide Configuration Approach**
   This may involve checking for conflicts between multiple TypeScript configurations in the monorepo structure and ensuring that the `moduleResolution` settings are consistently applied across all projects.

### TS-002: Type Definition Error in direct-fix.d.ts

**Description:**
Missing closing braces in type definition file. This was fixed by adding the missing braces.

**Severity:** High (Prevents application compilation)

**Technical Context:**  
The type definition file has a syntax error with a missing closing bracket.

**Evidence:**
```
ERROR in src/types/direct-fix.d.ts
TS1005: '}' expected.
```

**Affected Files:**
- src/types/direct-fix.d.ts

**Root Cause:**  
Incomplete type definition with missing closing bracket.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Review and correct the syntax in the direct-fix.d.ts file, ensuring all brackets are properly closed.

### LINT-001: Import Order Issues in Dashboard Component

**Description:**  
ESLint errors regarding improper import ordering.

**Severity:** Low (Style issue, doesn't affect functionality)

**Technical Context:**  
Imports are not placed at the top of the file as required by the project's ESLint configuration.

**Evidence:**
```
ERROR in [eslint] 
src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
  Line 36:1:  Import in body of module; reorder to top  import/first
  Line 37:1:  Import in body of module; reorder to top  import/first
  Line 38:1:  Import in body of module; reorder to top  import/first
  Line 39:1:  Import in body of module; reorder to top  import/first
```

**Affected Files:**
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

**Root Cause:**  
Import statements placed in the middle of the file rather than at the top.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Move all import statements to the top of the file.

### LINT-002: Anonymous Default Export

**Description:**  
ESLint warning about anonymous default export.

**Severity:** Low (Style issue, doesn't affect functionality)

**Technical Context:**  
ESLint is configured to prefer named exports over anonymous default exports.

**Evidence:**
```
src/components/ltht-wrappers/index.tsx
  Line 32:1:  Assign object to a variable before exporting as module default  import/no-anonymous-default-export
```

**Affected Files:**
- src/components/ltht-wrappers/index.tsx

**Root Cause:**  
The component is exporting an anonymous object as default.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Assign the exported object to a variable before exporting:
```javascript
const componentExports = {
  // component definitions
};

export default componentExports;
```

### REACT-001: Missing Dependencies in useEffect Hook

**Description:**  
React hook dependency warning in PatientContext component.

**Severity:** Medium (Potential side effect bugs)

**Technical Context:**  
The useEffect hook is missing a dependency, which could lead to stale closures and unexpected behavior.

**Evidence:**
```
src/contexts/PatientContext.tsx
  Line 69:6:  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchPatient'. Either include it or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

**Affected Files:**
- src/contexts/PatientContext.tsx

**Root Cause:**  
The fetchPatient function is used in the useEffect hook but not included in the dependency array.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Either:
1. Add fetchPatient to the dependency array (may require useCallback):
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchPatient();
}, [patientId, fetchPatient]);
```

2. Define fetchPatient inside the useEffect hook:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPatientData = async () => {
    // Function implementation
  };
  
  fetchPatientData();
}, [patientId]);
```

### ENV-001: Application Startup Issues

**Description:**  
The application fails to start due to the compounding effect of multiple TypeScript errors.

**Severity:** Critical (Prevents application from functioning)

**Technical Context:**  
The combination of TypeScript configuration issues and syntax errors prevents webpack from successfully compiling the application.

**Evidence:**
```
Failed to compile.
```

**Affected Components:**
- Application-wide

**Root Cause:**  
Multiple TypeScript and ESLint errors that need to be resolved before the application can compile and start.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Address the TypeScript configuration issues first (TS-001 and TS-002), then resolve the remaining linting and React hook issues.
