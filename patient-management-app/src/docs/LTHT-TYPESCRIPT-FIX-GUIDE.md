# LTHT React Components TypeScript Fix Guide

This document explains the TypeScript errors that were occurring in the application and the solutions implemented to fix them.

## Overview of Issues

The application had several TypeScript errors related to LTHT component usage:

1. **Missing Type Definitions**: No proper TypeScript declarations for LTHT components
2. **Type Incompatibilities**: Component prop types were incompatible with the expected types
3. **Inconsistent Import Paths**: Components were imported directly from original packages
4. **Duplicate Declarations**: Some type declarations had duplicate identifiers

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Type Definitions

We created proper TypeScript declaration files (`d.ts`) for all LTHT components in:
```
patient-management-app/src/types/ltht-components.d.ts
```

This file provides TypeScript declarations for all LTHT components, ensuring that TypeScript can properly validate the props passed to these components.

### 2. Centralized Component Wrappers

Created a centralized component wrapper module that re-exports all LTHT component wrappers:
```
patient-management-app/src/components/ltht-wrappers/index.tsx
```

This file imports the component wrappers from `utils/ltht-component-wrappers.tsx` and re-exports them, providing a single import location for all components.

### 3. Updated Import Paths

Changed all component imports from:
```typescript
import { Component } from '../../utils/ltht-component-wrappers';
```

To the centralized location:
```typescript
import { Component } from '../../components/ltht-wrappers';
```

### 4. Fixed Form Event Types

Updated form event handling to use the correct TypeScript types:
```typescript
// Before
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // ...
};

// After
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  // ...
};
```

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use the wrapper components**: Import all LTHT components from `components/ltht-wrappers` rather than directly from the original packages or from `utils/ltht-component-wrappers`.

2. **Type Safety**: Take advantage of TypeScript's type checking by properly typing all props, state, and event handlers.

3. **Extend Types When Needed**: If a component needs additional props not defined in the original component, extend the interface in the relevant file rather than using `any` or type assertions.

4. **Update Type Definitions**: If new LTHT components are used, add their type definitions to the `ltht-components.d.ts` file following the established pattern.

5. **Handle Form Events Correctly**: When working with form events, use the specific event type `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>` for submit handlers.

## Common TypeScript Errors and Solutions

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Module not found | Check import paths and ensure the component is exported from the wrappers |
| Type incompatibility | Make sure props match the defined interface |
| Missing properties | Ensure all required props are provided to components |
| Duplicate declarations | Check for duplicate interface or type declarations |

## Example Component Usage

```tsx
import { Card, Button, Form } from '../../components/ltht-wrappers';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission
  };

  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Body>
        <Form submitHandler={handleSubmit}>
          {/* Form content */}
          <Button type="submit" variant="primary">Submit</Button>
        </Form>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
};
